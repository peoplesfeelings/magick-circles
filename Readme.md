A tool for creating "magick circles," and also an art piece, when in presentation mode. Makes a good screen cleanser, if viewed in the browser's full screen mode.

Presentation mode (slideshow of selected combinations of polygons) runs if using the "presentation" URL param, like: peoplesfeelings.com/circles/index.html?presentation
